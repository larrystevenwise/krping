If you're building against a kernel.org kernel or a kernel with the
RDMA drivers included (ie non-ofed), then simply edit the Makefile,
change KSRC/KOBJ accordingly, and do 'make && make install'.

WARNING: The following instructions and the install-ofa.sh are very
out dated and won't work.  You're on your own...

If you want to build this on a system running the ofed drivers:

The Makefile included seems to work on some platforms, but the only
way I've seen to get a ofa-dependent module to build and generate the
correct module versions is to build the module inside the ofa kernel tree.

To that end I've created the install-ofa.sh script.  It will add the
rdma_krping module to the chelsio driver build directory and alter its
Makefile to build and install rdma_krping along with the iw_cxgb3 module.
Just run install-ofa.sh to get things going.  Make sure you have the
target ofed kernel tree available and configured.
